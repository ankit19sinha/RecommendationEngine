For that, we may need to consider associative rule mining. The reason to consider association as a factor is the assumption that maybe there's a pattern that users across the platform follow. It may be the case the learners on the website follow certain sequence of solving problems as they build upon a topic sequentially. On the other hand, the players may simply follow a sequence that gets them most points and helps them level up faster. It is for this purpose that we may consider finding association rules. \n",
